# UNICEF-Conflict-Escalation
This project was done in an attempt to create a new AI machine learning model based off xgboost, ffnn and transformer to better predict conflict escalation around the world.
Thank you to Ali Aseef Hasaan, Hilary Kong and Lamees Busaidii for your contributions as well as Dr. Scott Schwartz of UofT for overseeing this project.
